## How It Works

### Architecture

```
┌─────────────────┐
│   User Browser  │
│   (GitHub Pages)│
└────────┬────────┘
         │
         │ Fetch/Submit Scores
         │
         ▼
┌─────────────────┐
│  GitHub Gist    │
│  (JSON Backend) │
│                 │
│ leaderboard.json│
└─────────────────┘
```

### Data Flow

1. **Player wins game** → Clicks "Submit to Leaderboard"
2. **Game collects data**: name, clicks, time, pages
3. **Calculate score**: `clicks × 10 + time_in_seconds`
4. **Fetch current leaderboard** from Gist
5. **Add new entry** to array
6. **Sort by score** (lower is better)
7. **Keep top 100** entries
8. **Update Gist** with new data
9. **Show rank** to player

### Score Formula

**Lower is better!**

```
Score = (Clicks × 10) + Time in Seconds
```

Examples:
- 3 clicks + 45 seconds = **75 points** 🥇
- 5 clicks + 32 seconds = **82 points** 🥈
- 4 clicks + 67 seconds = **107 points** 🥉

### Security Considerations

✅ **Token Scope**: Limited to `gist` only  
✅ **Public Gist**: Read-only for everyone  
✅ **Write Access**: Controlled by token  
✅ **Rate Limits**: 5000 requests/hour (authenticated)  
✅ **Revocable**: Token can be revoked anytime  
✅ **Input Sanitization**: Player names are escaped  
✅ **Length Limits**: Names capped at 20 characters  

⚠️ **Known Issue**: Token visible in source code  
**Solution**: Use GitHub Actions to inject secrets during build

## Features Implemented

### User-Facing Features:
- ✅ Submit score with custom name
- ✅ View global top 10 leaderboard
- ✅ View recent games
- ✅ See your rank after submission
- ✅ Beautiful medal system (🥇🥈🥉)
- ✅ Mobile responsive design
- ✅ Loading states
- ✅ Error handling

### Technical Features:
- ✅ Caching (30 second cache)
- ✅ Async/await error handling
- ✅ Score sorting and ranking
- ✅ Top 100 entry limit
- ✅ HTML escaping for XSS prevention
- ✅ LocalStorage fallback for testing
- ✅ GitHub API integration
- ✅ Automatic retry on failure

## Setup Options

### Option 1: Local Testing (Default - Active Now)
```javascript
leaderboard = new LocalLeaderboard();
```
- ✅ Works immediately
- ✅ No setup required
- ❌ Local to your browser only

### Option 2: GitHub Gist (Production)
```javascript
leaderboard = new LeaderboardManager('gist_id', 'token');
```
- ✅ Global leaderboard
- ✅ Persistent storage
- ⚙️ Requires 5-min setup

### Option 3: GitHub Actions (Most Secure)
- Store token as GitHub Secret
- Auto-inject during deployment
- Token never in source code

## Testing Steps

### Local Testing (No Setup):
1. Open game in browser
2. Play and win
3. Submit score
4. Open leaderboard
5. See your score!

**Note**: Scores only visible on your device

### Production Testing (After Gist Setup):
1. Create Gist and token
2. Update app.js with credentials
3. Deploy to GitHub Pages
4. Open from different devices
5. Submit scores from each
6. Verify all scores appear globally

## Browser Compatibility

✅ Chrome/Edge (Desktop & Mobile)  
✅ Firefox (Desktop & Mobile)  
✅ Safari (Desktop & iOS)  
✅ Samsung Internet  
✅ Opera  

**Requires**: ES6+ support (all modern browsers)

## Performance

- **Initial Load**: <100ms (cached)
- **Fetch Leaderboard**: ~200-500ms
- **Submit Score**: ~500-1000ms
- **Cache Duration**: 30 seconds
- **Bundle Size**: ~15KB (leaderboard.js)

## Mobile Experience

- Responsive table design
- Touch-friendly buttons
- Compact layout on small screens
- Abbreviated route display
- No horizontal scrolling

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

### Easy Additions:
- [ ] Filter by date range
- [ ] Search by player name
- [ ] Show personal best
- [ ] Weekly/monthly rankings
- [ ] Share score to social media

### Advanced Features:
- [ ] Real-time updates (WebSockets)
- [ ] User authentication
- [ ] Profile pictures
- [ ] Achievement badges
- [ ] Challenge system
- [ ] Regional leaderboards

### Backend Alternatives:
- [ ] Firebase Realtime Database
- [ ] Supabase PostgreSQL
- [ ] Custom serverless API
- [ ] Cloudflare Workers + KV

## Maintenance

### Regular Tasks:
- **Monitor Gist size**: Keep top 100 entries
- **Check rate limits**: GitHub API limits
- **Rotate tokens**: Security best practice
- **Review scores**: Remove spam if needed

### Gist Management:
View/edit directly at:
```
https://gist.github.com/USERNAME/GIST_ID
```

Can manually:
- Delete spam entries
- Fix corrupted data
- Export backups
- Reset leaderboard
